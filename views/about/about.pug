          p.fadeInUpward As students from Class 2021, we believe that all Wego IEP students set out to fulfill super BIG dreams while studying or working abroad. Yet, as reality kicks in, sometimes even the very first steps ahead seem extremely intimidating. But you‚Äôre not alone. If we can have each other‚Äôs backs, we might just scrape by. Or even better, actually accomplish our goals! 
          p.fadeInUpward So, that's what we're trying to do. This alumni network is the very first goal we hope to realize ü§©

          p.fadeInUpward Mainly composed of alumni and a small number of student representatives, the advisory board meet regularly every six months and changes Board Members every two years. Based on the alumni's experiences at various universities, research institutes, and workplaces, we hope to reflect upon and enhance the current international program: curriculum, extracurricular activities, application, preparation for exams. We are determined to not only help students apply, but also help students clarify their future aspirations. The selection of Board members will be discerned by year, region, or industry.
